Designed and analyzed a 4Ã—4 MIMO antenna system integrated with a Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) structure to achieve dual-band operation at 1.8 GHz and 2.4 GHz. The antenna was modeled and simulated using CST Microwave Studio to evaluate its performance in terms of S-parameters, gain, and efficiency.
